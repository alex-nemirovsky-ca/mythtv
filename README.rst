MythTV Light Project Info
=====

This is a fork of MythTV. It will be kept up to date and I try to get fixes from here into the main MythTV repository.

Currently you will find Raspberry Pi support here that is ahead of the main `MythTV Project <https://github.com/MythTV/mythtv>`_.

Please log bugs related to this repository and build in the `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/bennettpeter/mythtv/issues>`_

Please log MythTV bugs in `Trac bug tracker <http://code.mythtv.org/trac>`_
