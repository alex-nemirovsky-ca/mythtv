# Developer Fork
I use this fork for researching, developing and testing upcoming changes to [MythTV](https://github.com/MythTV/mythtv).

See that project for more information.

## Raspberry Pi
For installation packages for Raspbian Jessie and Ubuntu Xenial, see [MythTV Light](https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/MythTV_Light) in the MythTV wiki.
